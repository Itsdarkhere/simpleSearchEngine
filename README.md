# simpleSearchEngine
SSE to search for names/emails from a text file. 

Hello friend!

This is my implementation of the hyperskill.org project Simple search engine.
Last stage implementation details: https://hyperskill.org/projects/66/stages/359/implement

Basic functionality in a nutshell:
Searching for names/emails from a textfile,
according to a search strategy that is chosen by the user.

Search strategies: ALL, ANY, or NONE.

ALL: Needs a precise match to return/print anything.

ANY: Needs any part of the name/email to return it.

NONE: Returns everything that does not match the input.

Program also has functionality for exiting and printing everything from file.
Project length: Approx 26H (According to Hyperskill, this includes theory).
